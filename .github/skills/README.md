# Skills Catalog

This file is a navigation index for humans and agents.

Use it to quickly identify the narrowest relevant skill for a task before loading the full `SKILL.md`.
The source of truth remains each skill's own `SKILL.md` file and its `description` frontmatter.

## How to use this index

1. Start here when the task domain is clear but the best skill is not.
2. Prefer the narrowest matching skill over a broad fallback.
3. Combine multiple skills when the task spans domains.
4. For implementation and review, pair domain skills with baseline quality and verification skills when relevant.
5. For imported upstream skills, use the local copy in this repository; treat upstream links as provenance only.

## Imported upstream skills

The following local skills were imported from the official Kotlin skills repository and should be used from their local paths in this repo:

- `kotlin-backend-jpa-entity-mapping` → source: [Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/kotlin-backend-jpa-entity-mapping)
- `kotlin-tooling-agp9-migration` → source: [Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/kotlin-tooling-agp9-migration)

## Selection rules for agents

1. Prefer a specific domain skill over a broad language skill.
   - Example: use `kotlin-backend-jpa-entity-mapping` instead of generic `kotlin` for Hibernate entity modeling.
   - Example: use `kotlin-tooling-agp9-migration` instead of generic `kotlin` for AGP 9 migration.
2. Combine domain + quality skills when reviewing or implementing non-trivial work.
   - Example: `kotlin` + `testing-qa` + `code-quality`
   - Example: `frontend-design` + `web-design-reviewer` + `testing-qa`
3. Use orchestration skills to support execution, not to replace domain skills.
   - Example: `planning-structure` helps make the plan, but it does not replace `api-design` or `kotlin`.
4. If multiple skills seem plausible, start with the narrowest one and add a broad fallback only if needed.
